# Change Log

* For the mode of the same routing protocol but with different communication ranges, support the unicast mode in which nodes with a large communication range can send messages to nodes with a small communication range.
* Add a central system that can obtain all DTNHost status to support central nodes commonly used in trust management mechanism of VANETs. An example is shown in the configuration file CSUnicast.txt.
